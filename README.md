# Air Usage
```actionscript
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.spotlight.Spotlight;
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.spotlight.SpotlightEvents;
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.spotlight.AttributeSet;
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.spotlight.ContentType;

var _ex:Spotlight = new Spotlight();
_ex.addEventListener(SpotlightEvents.INDEXING_SUCCESS, onIndexingSuccess);
_ex.addEventListener(SpotlightEvents.INDEXING_FAILURE, onIndexingFailure);
_ex.addEventListener(SpotlightEvents.DELETING_SUCCESS, onDeletingSuccess);
_ex.addEventListener(SpotlightEvents.DELETING_FAILURE, onDeletingFailure);
_ex.addEventListener(SpotlightEvents.SEARCH_SELECTED, onSearchSelected);

trace("isIndexingAvailable = " + _ex.isIndexingAvailable);

// add as many required items as required by your app
var att:AttributeSet = new AttributeSet(ContentType.kUTTypeItem, "com.site.uniquIdentifier.1", "domain.identifier.1");
att.general.title = "The title";
att.documents.contentDescription = "The description";
att.general.keywords = ["Adobe Air", "ANE", "MyFLashLabs"];
att.general.thumbnailURL = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath("spotlightIcon.jpg").nativePath;

// you should index your search items like this:
_ex.indexItems([att]);

private function onIndexingSuccess(e:SpotlightEvents):void
{
	trace("on indexing completed successfully");
}

private function onIndexingFailure(e:SpotlightEvents):void

}

private function onDeletingFailure(e:SpotlightEvents):void
{
	trace("on deleting failed: " + e.msg);
}

private function onSearchSelected(e:SpotlightEvents):void
{
	// when an item is touched in the spotlight search results, the unique identifier will be delivered here
	// so you will know which of your items has been selected and can take the user to a specefic page related
	// to what they have clicked.
	trace("on search result touched: " + e.msg);

# Requirements 
1. iOS SDK 9.0 or higher
2. Air SDK 22 or higher
3. Requires [OverrideAir](https://github.com/myflashlab/common-dependencies-ANE) dependency file.

# Tech Details
* If you are testing your app in debug mode, the ```SpotlightEvents.SEARCH_SELECTED``` listener might not be dispatched when your app is launching because the debug connection process may take a while before the app starts and the event happens before you have the time to listen to it! We hope Adobe can fix this bug in future versions of Air SDK. However, when you test your app in release or adHoc mode, the ```SpotlightEvents.SEARCH_SELECTED``` listener will be dispatched everytime your app starts because of the spotlight search item being touched.
